At the beging of this year i was feeling that my life need a change, a change to better myself and my future. I have work at my job for seven years and have had multipule parts jobs as well, I felt like i still needed a change in life, so i started looking at what i wanted to do in life. I went through may options and my friend one day told me that i should look into coding.

When i started looking into coding i realized i was very interested in wanting to learn more. The idea to get to know how software is put together made me want to start looking right away. I found Flatiron school while looking for a way to learn coding. 

Im very excited to be apart of Flatiron school and learn my dream job Software engineering. Also im excited about meeting new people along the way.
